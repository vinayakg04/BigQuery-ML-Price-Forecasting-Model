For linear regression models we want to use a loss metric like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
We want to keep training and improving the model until it has the lowest RMSE.
In BQML, mean_squared_error is a queryable field when evaluating our trained ML model. We Add a SQRT() to get RMSE.

To evaluate how the models performs run the follwing queury in big query editor-


#standardSQL
SELECT
  SQRT(mean_squared_error) AS rmse
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL taxi.taxifare_model,
  (
  WITH params AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS TRAIN,
    2 AS EVAL
    ),
  daynames AS
    (SELECT ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tues', 'Wed', 'Thurs', 'Fri', 'Sat'] AS daysofweek),
  taxitrips AS (
  SELECT
    (tolls_amount + fare_amount) AS total_fare,
    daysofweek[ORDINAL(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM pickup_datetime))] AS dayofweek,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM pickup_datetime) AS hourofday,
    pickup_longitude AS pickuplon,
    pickup_latitude AS pickuplat,
    dropoff_longitude AS dropofflon,
    dropoff_latitude AS dropofflat,
    passenger_count AS passengers
  FROM
    `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`, daynames, params
  WHERE
    trip_distance > 0 AND fare_amount > 0
    AND MOD(ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CAST(pickup_datetime AS STRING))),1000) = params.EVAL
  )
  SELECT *
  FROM taxitrips
  ))
