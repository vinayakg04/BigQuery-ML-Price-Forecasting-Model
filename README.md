# BigQuery-ML-Price-Forecasting-Model
We Create a machine learning model in BigQuery to predict the price of a cab ride in New York City given the historical dataset of trips and trip data. Predicting the fare before the ride could be very useful for trip planning for both the rider and the taxi agency.
We have used the New York City Yellow Cab dataset to find useful features that will help a machine learning model understand the relationship between data about historical cab rides and the price of the fare.

For the Fare Forecasting Model we have the following important fields

Tolls Amount

Fare Amount

Hour of Day

Pick up address

Drop off address

Number of passengers
