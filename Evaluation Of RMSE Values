For linear regression models you want to use a loss metric like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 
We want to keep training and improving the model until it has the lowest RMSE.
Knowing whether or not this loss metric is acceptable to productionalize our model is entirely dependent on your benchmark criteria, which is set before model training begins.
Benchmarking is establishing a minimum level of model performance and accuracy that is acceptable.

We have gotten the RMSE down to: +-$$5.12 which is significantly better than +-$$9.47 for our first model.

Since RMSE defines the standard deviation of prediction errors, we see that the retrained linear regression made our model a lot more accurate.
